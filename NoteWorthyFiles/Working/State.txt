CadavreExquis.nwc:
- Triplets!!

Chinatown.nwc:
- Stems down
- Automatic Beam

GrodardDong.nwc:
- Tempo Staff breaks the output. I think dealing with the tempo info is enough!!!!
- No time signature is provided. Should deal with this automatically!!
- Notes positions are ugly
- Measure have to be enlarged when too many notes are present (second measure for example) 
- Different key signatures for each instrument!!!!

LaGrasseBandeTeMouilleLaChatte.nwc:
- No output so far. Certainly due to Tempo Segment at each Staff.
- Only one measure detected in /jsonapi/tunes/${tuneId}/
- Deal with text. See VexFlow exemples...

Percu.nwc: 
- Can't see the line entirely. Make use of the sliding bar.

TakeFifteen.nwc:
- Multiple Problems. Doesn't deal with lines without measures. 

test.nwc:
- A larger space is needed between the signatures and the first note. 
- Same remark with the bars and the first note of each measure.
